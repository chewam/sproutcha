SPROUTCHA
==========

The SproutCha aim:
--------------------

Compare javascript libraries thanks to small examples illustrating some imporant features of these frameworks.
At the moment the comparison applies only to SproutCore and Sencha frameworks, other frameworks are coming soon...

The SproutCha rules:
---------------------
- develop simple examples to show how the frameworks work.
- ensure that example look and feel is the same regardless of the library used.
- use the same REST backend: [http://demo.revolunet.com:9876/api/v1/employee](http://demo.revolunet.com:9876/api/v1/employee).
